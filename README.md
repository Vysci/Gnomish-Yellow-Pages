the row of trade skill buttons will access the entire database of trade recipes so you can search for whatever recipe you wish. click to open whatever trade skill browser you use.

when browsing a trade skill, selecting a recipe will cause gyp to update the trade link color to light blue if that recipe is contained in that link. also any searches in the trade skill browser will be reflected in the gyp link color -- links that contain none of the recipes returned by the search will be dark yellow; normal yellow links indicate that at least one of the recipes in the browser window matches the trade link.
